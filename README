This is the README file for thid flavour of Tic-Tac-Toe Django.

This is a django project Tic-Tac-Toe game.  The general approach was to develop a game.py file
with a class for accessing a game instance and the available AI.  The tests.py file contains
coverage testing for the TicTacToe game.  The website implements a human vs. computer interface
using Django views and templates.  I choose to take the low-level Django cacheing API for a spin
for it seemed the obvious decision for a tiny game like Tic-Tac-Toe.  I'm reminded of an arcade
style game where state is destined to expire.  There is no need for the fancy overhead of sessions
and authentication.  Despite the persistence of a SQLite database, a databae is not neccessary.
Other features of this implementation:
* In memory cacheing for quick access of game state
* Folk without cookies could enjoy this Django game
* Game state preserved on server for up to 10 minutes from user activity
Possible sticking points:
* Usernames are not protected and therefore it is possible two simultaenous users could try
    playing the game with the exact same username and collide in the cache.  
    We suggest in the UI that users pick a unique name.
* URLs alter game state (in cache) without POST however views handle boundary checks.
